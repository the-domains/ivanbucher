# A new journey, a new website

Welcome to IvanBucher.com! I've been wanting a space to share my life and thoughts for some time. I think this platform will let me do it the way I've wanted.

I've imagined...

Something that would compile my interests into something all my own while being nice to look at on any device.

Something that serves as a neutral place for my friends and followers to relate with me from the different places they come, whether geographically, spiritually, or vocationally.

Something that would mix my job in ministry with my other communities in an authentic way that anyone can jump in on and be welcomed.

Something that could would flex aesthetically to the various types of postings I'll be sharing.

Something that helps me focus to keep my focus on making quality content so you can be inspired, informed, and entertained.

So, what's this platform?

I really think this will let me do all of this. It's malleable, smart, and effortless. It lets me bring you better stuff so we can connect the way we hope to connect.

It is still in Beta, so I have yet to see all its possibilities. But I am quite hopeful!

As for the journey... glad you caught that. I am in the process of moving my little family to New York City for our work with college students. That pretty much sums it up for now. Thanks for the read!

More to come!
