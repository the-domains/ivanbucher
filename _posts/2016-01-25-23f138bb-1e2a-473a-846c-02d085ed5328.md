# A new journey, a new website

Welcome to IvanBucher.com! I've been wanting a space to share my life and thoughts for some time now. I think I found a platform that will let me do it the way I've been imagining.

What have I imagined? Glad you asked!

* Something that would compile the scope of my broad interests into something coherent and nice to look at on any device.

* Something that stands alone as a place for my friends and followers to relate with me from all over the web.

* Something that would mix my job in ministry with my other communities in an authentic way that anyone can jump in on and be welcomed.

* Something that could would flex aesthetically to the various types of postings I'll be doing.

* Something that helps me focus on quality content so you can actually draw inspiration, information, and even entertainment from the breadth of posts I'll be building on this site.

So, what' this platform?

I really think this will let me do all of this. It's fresh, malleable, smart, and effortless. It lets me focus on bringing you good stuff.

It's still in Beta, so we have yet to see all the possibilities. But I am hopeful!

As for the journey... glad you caught that. I am in the process of moving my little family to New York City for our work with college students.

More to come!
